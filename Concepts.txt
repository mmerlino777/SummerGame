3 different levels of charged throw
1) No charge, ball goes a distance, falls with gravity, bounces a few times, ball becomes dead shortly after
2) Medium charge, ball goes straight an even further distance before gravity acting on it, bounces off walls for more bounces, ball eventually becomes dead
3) Heavy Charge, ball goes straight and faster, far distance before gravity acts on it, bouncing a lof off of the walls, ball eventually becomes dead.
